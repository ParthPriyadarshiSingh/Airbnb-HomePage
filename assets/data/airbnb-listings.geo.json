The balcony is big for the apartment size - but do note it backs onto a main road so it can be noisy - the windows and doors are double glazed so inside its peaceful - but outside you'll experience some traffic. However so long as you're not overly sensitive to traffic noise its great - I often sit outside on the balcony to eat dinner and relax in summer.","description":"Close to the heart of Bondi!

I love new cultures, nature, creativity and adventures. I enjoy socialising and meeting new people and sharing some stories and laughs. I love creating a beautiful and nurturing home atmosphere, and doing things such as cooking delicious meals, pottering about in the garden, going on beach walks, catching up with friends, having quiet time at home and making and creating art. I also love cats!  \r\nMy favourite holiday destination so far is Byron Bay and Bali. I love the hot weather, and all things tropical. And the people in both places are very friendly and open minded and fun. \r\nI like British comedy, Australian drama series on abc, and documentaries by people such as Louis Theroux. \r\n\r\n5 things I can't live without are: a cat, my friends, my expressive dance classes, music, nature and colour!\r\n\r\nMy style of hosting is to be friendly and warm, yet respect the space and people and allow ease and comfort to prevail. \r\n\r\nThe beauty of Airbnb, is that it seems to bend the truth on the line 'there's no place like home'. It is wonderful that there is this system set up, whereby we can travel anywhere and experience other places, like home, but different, and be warmly welcomed, and do the things we do at home.

The private room is fully air-conditioned with a slim line TV and tea\/coffee making facilities.   This space would suit an executive, couple or a single.\r\n\r\nI've lived in this area for over 20 years and love the proximity to Albert Park Village, Gas Works Park, MSAC, the vibrancy of St Kilda, Luna Park, Sunday Market, beaches, Melbourne bikes, 24\/7 Gym, Community Bus, 3 tram routes (1, 96, 112) which transports you to the best that inner Melbourne has to offer.   \r\n\r\nBack to my evening....I'm about to venture onto the main balcony with a glass of vino and dinner....sauvignon  blanc is appealing tonight....light and crisp.  \r\n\r\nThat's a little bit about me, your host!

A: As said in our listing, we do not encourage parents with children or young babies to stay with us. Our home is not childproof and we can not ensure that it is safe for your children at all times.

Eden works at a hospital and Whitney is a marketing coordinator and fashion designer. We are a couple from Sydney who love to relax, enjoy travelling and are always on the go, either for work or holidaying. We are fortunately to live in one of the best and safest suburbs in inner Sydney and love hosting guests as well as have guests host us while we go place to place. Whitney has recently launched her own fashion line and we love meeting new people to learn from.\r\n\r\nAs hosts, we like to give our guests space and freedom. With our own hectic schedules, we are happy to accommodate guests required times and are happy to have guests around at any time. We are always available to contact and love offering advice and suggestions on nearby places. We are also always keen for a drink or a snack with our guests and love connecting with new people.\r\n\r\nWhen travelling, we are looking for the personal touch and love being immersed in cultures. We are often travelling to avoid the daily grind at home and love trying new things. Having been to 30 countries combined, our whole lives are travelling and we love speaking to people about their homes.\r\n\r\nOur Airbnb experience is about giving guests the best and cleanest room, while also relaxing and giving them the space they want. We are not neat freaks and hold parties now and then, which we invite our guests to interact with. We believe that your room must be cleaned to the highest standard and that you must be completely fulfilled while staying with us. But we do hate Airbnbers who think it is like booking a hotel - don't book with is if this is what you're after!\r\n\r\nWe are late sleepers and are addicted to keeping up with pop culture, with TV watching always high on our list of things to do. We eat dinner late and are always amending to our busy timetables.

I love sharing a great meal with others.\r\nLong sleep in's on Sundays or any day really.\r\nWater. I love swimming in the ocean or rivers. Lets keep them clean.\r\nMusic. Anything from opera to house.\r\n\r\nAs your host, I will be on call to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If anything goes wrong during your stay, say the washing machine won't start or something, I will have it sorted immediately. I've had guest stay at my place for 3 month and then extend up to 16 months. I've had guests who moved out and then told me if they could stay forever they would be very happy. \r\n\r\nAs someone who has travelled a lot with work and stayed in hotels motels and apartments both long and short term, I set out to create a space that was a real home away from home. Somewhere where you can feel safe, warm and cosy and enjoy a good home cooked meal. It was all about atmosphere. A deep bath to relax in, comfy couches to put your feet up on, a big TV to tune out to and stunning view whilst enjoying your breakfast. In winter turn on the gas log fireplace and enjoy a glass of wine. Head out to one of the many great eating establishments on Chapel St, Fitzroy St or take a tram to the city. the tram stop is a 2 minute walk away.\r\n\r\nEveryone who has stayed at Charnwood has enjoyed their stay.

I also love cats!  \r\nMy favourite holiday destination so far is Byron Bay and Bali. I love the hot weather, and all things tropical. And the people in both places are very friendly and open minded and fun. \r\nI like British comedy, Australian drama series on abc, and documentaries by people such as Louis Theroux. \r\n\r\n5 things I can't live without are: a cat, my friends, my expressive dance classes, music, nature and colour!\r\n\r\nMy style of hosting is to be friendly and warm, yet respect the space and people and allow ease and comfort to prevail. \r\n\r\nThe beauty of Airbnb, is that it seems to bend the truth on the line 'there's no place like home'. It is wonderful that there is this system set up, whereby we can travel anywhere and experience other places, like home, but different, and be warmly welcomed, and do the things we do at home.

I love the markets, the lost afternoons at the park with the kids, I love the stunning views offered by a walk around the famous Albert Park lake, the glorious summer days and the rugged up winters but most of all I love sharing it, enjoying Melbourne with family, friends, sharing her secrets with visitors.\r\nAs your host I am more than happy to offer as much help and advice as I can to help you get the best from your time here in St Kilda and Melbourne.  I hope that our studio provides everything you may need during your stay and I trust that you will call if there is anything further we can do.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":90,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/2708837\/profile_pic\/1380779081\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/2708837\/profile_pic\/1380779081\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"St Kilda","host_listings_count":2,"host_total_listings_count":2,"host_verifications":["email","phone","facebook","reviews","jumio"],"street":"St Kilda, St Kilda, VIC 3182, Australia","neighbourhood":"St Kilda","neighbourhood_cleansed":"Port Phillip","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"St Kilda","state":"VIC","zipcode":"3182","market":"Melbourne","smart_location":"St Kilda, Australia","country_code":"AU","country":"Australia","latitude":"-37.86928896563099","longitude":"144.98048566853626","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Entire home\/apt","accommodates":2,"bathrooms":1.0,"bedrooms":1,"beds":1,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Internet","Wireless Internet","Air conditioning","Kitchen","Buzzer\/wireless intercom","Heating","Family\/kid friendly","Washer","Dryer","Smoke detector","Essentials","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49"],"square_feet":null,"price":105,"weekly_price":750,"monthly_price":2650,"security_deposit":200,"cleaning_fee":null,"guests_included":1,"extra_people":0,"minimum_nights":3,"maximum_nights":1125,"calendar_updated":"4 days ago","has_availability":null,"availability_30":2,"availability_60":2,"availability_90":2,"availability_365":2,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-04-03","number_of_reviews":162,"first_review":"2013-01-22","last_review":"2017-03-20","review_scores_rating":95,"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":null,"cancellation_policy":"moderate","calculated_host_listings_count":2,"reviews_per_month":3.17,"features":["Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified","Is Location Exact","Instant Bookable"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.8217871887729,-37.86883814092864]},"properties":{"id":"12819574","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/12819574","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-03","name":"\u524d\u6fb3\u6d32\u5973\u603b\u7406\u5c45\u4f4f\u7684\u5c0f\u533aAltona\uff0cwalk\u5230\u6d77\u8fb9\u5341\u5206\u949f","summary":"Close to the beach,supermarket,restaurants and coffee shop etc.Walk to the train station just 10 minutes and go to the city only 20 minutes.I have a dog who is lovely and kind and loves people a lot.","space":"My place is close to the train station and supermarket,restaurants,coffee shop etc.Walk to the beach just 15 minutes. \u79bb\u5730\u94c1\u8d70\u8def10\u5206\u949f,\u5750\u5730\u94c120\u5206\u949f\u5230\u5e02\u533a\uff61\u8d70\u8def10\u5206\u949f\u5230\u6d77\u8fb9,\u9644\u8fd1\u5c31\u6709\u8d85\u5e02,\u996d\u5e97,\u5496\u5561\u5e97\u7b49\uff61","description":"Close to the beach,supermarket,restaurants and coffee shop etc.Walk to the train station just 10 minutes and go to the city only 20 minutes.I have a dog who is lovely and kind and loves people a lot.

There's is a train station about 500m away and my sister goes to city every day and it takes her 10-15 min by train.

In the other direction it goes through Royal Park, to the Melbourne Zoo and onwards to West Coburg. No. 57 goes through the heart of North Melbourne, past Victoria Market and into Elizabeth Street central city. In the other direction it goes out to Maribynong and is probably the closest tram to take you to HighPoint Shopping Centre No. 59 takes you past Royal Children's Hospital, Royal Women's Hospital, Royal Melbourne Hospital and is the best tram to get to Melbourne University and RMIT University from my place. It then continues on past the Victoria Market and into Elizabeth St in the central city. In the other direction it heads out to Essendon. Trains - Flemington Bridge and Kensington Railway stations are the two closest. Both will take you into town.

People who are not declared as part of the original airbnb booking request will not be given access to our home. If you have booked as a single, an extra guest cannot be brought into the house without prior (ie not on the doorstep) arrangement.

I have worked as a freelance Arts producer, consultant special events producer and I have been involved in the making of two TV dramas in the UK and two documentary films in Australia. I set up and managed an accommodation business for a few years as a way to remain at home to look after my mother who has dementia and Alzheimer's disease before she finally went into aged care. I am now working (part-time) in a really interesting role, which I love and in my free time I am reading, attending arts events, spending time in nature, hiking, swimming and seeing friends. \r\n\r\nMy home in St Kilda is a large Victorian Mansion (1880), split into four large apartments. \r\n\r\nThe house in Balnarring is a very special haven for large groups, families and friends. It has a tree house, which I proudly helped to source materials for and build with my son alongside a dear friend, Bene, a master carpenter, craftsman, boat builder from Belgium. \r\n\r\nI enjoy family & friends, good food, great stories, films, transformative art, theatre and music and I love hiking, gardening & most things in the great outdoors. I have always loved to travel and have done so all my working and playing life. My son is overseas at Uni & hence his large, QS ensuite bedroom is available a lot of the time. I also travel overseas and with my job and so the entire apartment is also available on occasions. \r\n\r\nI enjoy camping - \"doing it basic\" and in the past I have equally enjoyed five star luxury, but less so now as I'm a bit fed up with the over emphasis on having to have the very best of everything at the expense of the environment and a living wage!  I now prefer to use Airbnb as its a great way to stay in some amazing places, meet locals and to gain their insight into their towns, cities & villages. I have used Airbnb in Sydney, Hobart, Brisbane, London, Los Angeles, California & Vancouver when visiting friends and family, not just to divert funds to other things but because I like chilling out in a homely environment, visiting local markets & cooking with great ingredients rather than eating out all the time. I love staying in beautiful individual Airbnb houses with everything one might need while on holiday. I am generally interested in a culture of exchange and sharing. I hate waste. I have been able to develop so many ideas and projects with the skills, expertise & open attitude of those Helpxers & Woofers who have worked with me running both businesses over the years, plus I regularly host and participate in Clothes & Skills Swaps. All of these schemes have enriched my life and brought me into contact with some amazing people from all over the world. I have not only learned new skills, but I have also gained incredible insights into other cultures and experiences of those I have met in Australia and overseas.","host_response_time":"within a few hours","host_response_rate":90,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/2717113\/profile_pic\/1436794826\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/2717113\/profile_pic\/1436794826\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"St Kilda","host_listings_count":1,"host_total_listings_count":1,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio"],"street":"St Kilda, Saint Kilda West, VIC 3182, Australia","neighbourhood":"St Kilda","neighbourhood_cleansed":"Port Phillip","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"Saint Kilda West","state":"VIC","zipcode":"3182","market":"Melbourne","smart_location":"Saint Kilda West, Australia","country_code":"AU","country":"Australia","latitude":"-37.86054837714133","longitude":"144.97391882948213","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Private room","accommodates":2,"bathrooms":2.0,"bedrooms":1,"beds":1,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Cable TV","Internet","Wireless Internet","Kitchen","Free parking on premises","Indoor fireplace","Buzzer\/wireless intercom","Heating","Dryer","Smoke detector","First aid kit","Fire extinguisher","Essentials","Shampoo","Lock on bedroom door","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50"],"square_feet":null,"price":121,"weekly_price":null,"monthly_price":null,"security_deposit":null,"cleaning_fee":20,"guests_included":1,"extra_people":0,"minimum_nights":2,"maximum_nights":1125,"calendar_updated":"today","has_availability":null,"availability_30":30,"availability_60":60,"availability_90":90,"availability_365":91,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-04-03","number_of_reviews":9,"first_review":"2016-10-04","last_review":"2017-03-25","review_scores_rating":100,"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":null,"cancellation_policy":"strict","calculated_host_listings_count":1,"reviews_per_month":1.48,"features":["Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified","Is Location Exact"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[145.02001097144958,-37.717023142527665]},"properties":{"id":"7959317","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/7959317","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-04","name":"Furnished room with Wifi access","summary":"Comfortable and Furnished House, close to bus stop and La Trobe University.. 30 minutes to city by train. -Single bed with built in robes (sheets, donna, pillow - all provided) -Study Desk -Friendly housemates -Second single mattress for second guest or we have a double room to occupy if a couple.

I've only ever had wonderful experiences as an Airbnb guest, so I'm thrilled to have a home to offer to you as a host\/roomie\/new friend.","host_response_time":"within a few hours","host_response_rate":90,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/pictures\/417f2016-a091-4702-8839-935dd8992fcc.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/pictures\/417f2016-a091-4702-8839-935dd8992fcc.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":null,"host_listings_count":1,"host_total_listings_count":1,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio"],"street":"Los Angeles, CA 90038, United States","neighbourhood":null,"neighbourhood_cleansed":"Hollywood","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"Los Angeles","state":"CA","zipcode":"90038","market":"Los Angeles","smart_location":"Los Angeles, CA","country_code":"US","country":"United States","latitude":"34.08964422553218","longitude":"-118.32644383923041","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Private room","accommodates":2,"bathrooms":1.0,"bedrooms":1,"beds":1,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Internet","Wireless Internet","Air conditioning","Kitchen","Smoke detector","Carbon monoxide detector","Fire extinguisher","Essentials","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50"],"square_feet":null,"price":70,"weekly_price":null,"monthly_price":1600,"security_deposit":null,"cleaning_fee":null,"guests_included":1,"extra_people":15,"minimum_nights":2,"maximum_nights":21,"calendar_updated":"today","has_availability":null,"availability_30":12,"availability_60":36,"availability_90":66,"availability_365":66,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-05-03","number_of_reviews":58,"first_review":"2016-11-26","last_review":"2017-04-22","review_scores_rating":99,"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":"City of Los Angeles, CA","cancellation_policy":"strict","calculated_host_listings_count":1,"reviews_per_month":10.94,"features":["Host Is Superhost","Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[145.1287857009079,-38.07873342190748]},"properties":{"id":"14674077","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/14674077","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-04","name":"Private room with ensuite and walk in robe.","summary":"My place is close to the beach and parks.

The location is ideal for experiencing Melbourne's finest bars and restaurants.   As there are so many within the area I have left a list of my personal favourites in the apartment for your information, feel free to take a copy!","notes":"The apartment is located on the 3rd floor and unfortunately there is no lift as it is a National Trust-Registered Building with only 8 apartments.  I guess you could look at it as good exercise! There are facilities to cook with in the apartment which if you decide to use I recommend using the exhaust fan as the building's fire alarm is linked directly to the fire brigade so if the alarm is triggered it can be a costly exercise. I'm a fan of conserving energy so while I provide air conditioning to the property if they are left on after you vacate the apartment there will be an additional charge. The apartment is set up for 4 people but should you require it there is a double sofa bed in the lounge room which accommodates another 2 people. The flat is in walking distance to most places in and around the city and the public transport links are great but if you are driving and need parking there is a 24 hour carpark directly across the street. There is Wifi and Netflix connected for you t","transit":"On Bourke Street there are two trams the 96 which will take you to Nicholson Street heading north or St.Kilda beach via the city in the opposite direction and the 86 which will take you to Smith Street, Fitzroy and the City\/Docklands in the opposite direction.   Both of these trams will take you to and from Spencer Street station which is where the Skybus arrives and departs for the airport every 10 to 15 minutes. Parliament train station is 50m away at the corner of Bourke and Spring Streets. One block away is Collins Street where you can get the 48 tram to Brunswick Street Taking a tram within the city grid is free, make sure you are aware of where the free tram zone ends as travelling outside this zone without a valid ticket could result in a fine which isn't my idea of a great souvenir!  For public transport in Melbourne we have a smartcard ticketing system called myki. You can use myki to travel on trains, trams and buses. Always remember to touch on and off your myki each time yo","access":"You will have the entire apartment to yourself.  The building is very secure.

Its a real up and coming art & cultural hub of Sydney, still in its gowing stages but thats what keeps it interesting, its like a new gallery \/ bar \/ cafe opens every week! a lot to explore just stepping out the door... There are many great cafes & bakeries within a 3 or so minute walk from the apartment, too many to choose from ( i can recommend my favourite), a lot of independent galleries ..White rabbit gallery is a must and its just a couple of blocks away... short walks to central park \/ broadway that has a lot of restaurants & supermarkets ... Chippendale & Redfern  have some great small bars ( i can give you a list of the good ones to go to also)... Eveleigh markets @ Carriageworks (also an amazing multi arts space) is amazing for a saturday morning wander & brekky thats  close by, i go there every saturday morning. Even though there is plenty to keep you occupied locally, the real benefit is how easy and convenient it is to get","notes":"For its central location its mostly a nice quiet , calm space where, traffic noise isn't often noticeable and its pretty much calm and relaxing, most of the time ;)... however it must be noted that sound travels in this old creaky building , and for example if a photoshoot is going on downstairs, you can hear it and things like that. while its not bad, its not a little totally quiet bubble, so it might not be ideal if you are super noise sensitive :) at night however, mostly  it is generally really relaxed and quiet .. The weekends can be a little noisier in the neighbourhood, and sound does travel to the apartment, and so once again if you are noise sensitive when sleeping or in general, the serenity cant be guaranteed ;) and the space might not be idea for you... me, i love the vibrant living and knowing im surrounded by things going on and kind of like the buzz, when its there ;) but, some people might not fancy it.   > PLEASE take great care when walking up the stairs with your bag","transit":"VERY convenient for Transport. Bus stop is about 25m from the front door. Cabs can be flagged from the front door pretty easily. 5 mins walk to Redfern ( that connects to every station in sydney, except airport line) 10 min walk to Central train, which goes everywhere... Super easy! Friendly Bike shop across the road that you can hire bikes and cycle around the city - they make great coffee too and Dutch breakfasts. Also, very easy walk to the City , Chinatown, Surry Hills, Glebe , new Kensington Street , & close to Newtown ( all less then 2kms) . Its about a 15-20 minute drive to the Airport and a cab will cost about 20-25... not bad! Street parking is available although there are time limits in place, so you take your chances with parking... Paid parking at Sydney Uni Carparks available.","access":"Kitchen for the guests to use ( please note , the actual OVEN doesn't work presently ( BUT - there is a new bench top hotplate (perfect for scrambling eggs etc, and there is a new microwave-oven) .  There is ample tea & coffee, and all utensils \/ cooking and dining ware you could need. So help yourself to the use of the kitchen and the perishable food items, and of course the herbal teas \/ coffee etc... there is a  New TV  with DVD player & you can play music with a bluetooth speaker system. Lots of space to keep luggage. heater & fan in studio... (please note, no central heating or air conditioning) the space is well temperature  balanced though, so I find these are good enough in the space. :)","interaction":"I work freelance and so my job has taken me somewhere, probably Melbourne ( however i am available all times on phone\/ email)  and my good friend lives very close, so she can be there in case or urgency) Guests will have all the space, independence and privacy they desire.   - Please note there are big loft windows that look out onto the alley that I'm used to , and so it is quite open, but there are blinds that cover these if you like some privacy :) ... I find it feels very private, and the bedroom area has its own curtains if you want to still leave the blinds up, which i like doing to keep the feeling of the open space...","house_rules":"One Very important requirement... During the day 7 days a week, my building is a place of work & home for some really lovely people who are doing amazing work. the walls alas are not very soundproof, and so sound can travel.. pretty easily. This apartment is NOT suitable to people intending on turning it into party studio... by all means have a great time and relax in the space, but As i have lovely neighbours who's eardrums, workspace & sleep need to be respected, i ask that you please  dont have it as a party space and keep noise down after around 11 or so ... play music, relax,have a couple of friends over  and enjoy yourselves for sure, but its not cool to blast the music super loud and party on till the break of dawn... It is a creative space but also a professional one first and foremost, and this is something that is SUPER important and please only apply if you respect this ... :) Its a really fun and easy going building to be in with lots of lovely interesting people, and so if","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/pictures\/58438334\/3ee87c2f_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","medium_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/pictures\/58438334\/3ee87c2f_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","picture_url":null,"xl_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/pictures\/58438334\/3ee87c2f_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large","host_id":"1305359","host_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/users\/show\/1305359","host_name":"Penny","host_since":"2011-10-18","host_location":"New South Wales, Australia","host_about":"I am a freelance photographer that lives in Sydney, that works all over Australia, and that loves to explore the world..\r\n\r\nI have lived in share houses  & travelled staying on friends couches, for many years, and also of course used Air B'n'b many (URL HIDDEN) I am completely respectful of other peoples environments \/ belongings \/ lives... \r\n\r\nAs a host : I open up my home to people i hope enjoy the city and the space as much as i do , and are respectful...and in return i will be as helpful and sharing as possible, so you can have an amazing experience of the beautiful and amazing city that is sydney!

This space would suit an executive, couple or a single.\r\n\r\nI've lived in this area for over 20 years and love the proximity to Albert Park Village, Gas Works Park, MSAC, the vibrancy of St Kilda, Luna Park, Sunday Market, beaches, Melbourne bikes, 24\/7 Gym, Community Bus, 3 tram routes (1, 96, 112) which transports you to the best that inner Melbourne has to offer.   \r\n\r\nBack to my evening....I'm about to venture onto the main balcony with a glass of vino and dinner....sauvignon  blanc is appealing tonight....light and crisp.  \r\n\r\nThat's a little bit about me, your host!

Jackson's Landing is the exclusive area of the suburb and features high rise apartments with full views of the city, with very little street parking available. The Star casino is 2 mins away and popular Darling Harbour is about 10 mins away by walk. Also the apartment is nearby the Sydney Fish Markets, Wentworth Park and Central.","notes":"FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PLACE: Q: Is it near the Lightrail? A: The apartment is about 4 minutes away (walking) from the Lightrail and easy to get to - it's just around the corner.  Q: Do you have an elevator? A: Yes! No need to walk up 7 sets of stairs! But you can only access the elevator with a swipekey or when you buzz somebody up. There is also fire escape stairs to evacuate in case of an emergency.  Q: Is the neighborhood safe? A: Extraordinarily. Jacksons Landing is commonly referred to as a retirement village because it is safe, peaceful, quiet and people-friendly. Q: Do I need to bring towels, a hair dryer, or linens? A: Nope! We provide all these things! However if you would like to iron, please bring your own. Q: What does \"Flexible\" check-in\/-out time mean?  A: I will try to accommodate your check-in or check-out, no matter what time it is. Note that early check ins are not always possible if I have a guest leaving that morning, as I need to allow them to check","transit":"There is lots of public transport available.

Eden works at a hospital and Whitney is a marketing coordinator and fashion designer. We are a couple from Sydney who love to relax, enjoy travelling and are always on the go, either for work or holidaying. We are fortunately to live in one of the best and safest suburbs in inner Sydney and love hosting guests as well as have guests host us while we go place to place. Whitney has recently launched her own fashion line and we love meeting new people to learn from.\r\n\r\nAs hosts, we like to give our guests space and freedom. With our own hectic schedules, we are happy to accommodate guests required times and are happy to have guests around at any time. We are always available to contact and love offering advice and suggestions on nearby places. We are also always keen for a drink or a snack with our guests and love connecting with new people.\r\n\r\nWhen travelling, we are looking for the personal touch and love being immersed in cultures. We are often travelling to avoid the daily grind at home and love trying new things. Having been to 30 countries combined, our whole lives are travelling and we love speaking to people about their homes.\r\n\r\nOur Airbnb experience is about giving guests the best and cleanest room, while also relaxing and giving them the space they want. We are not neat freaks and hold parties now and then, which we invite our guests to interact with. We believe that your room must be cleaned to the highest standard and that you must be completely fulfilled while staying with us. But we do hate Airbnbers who think it is like booking a hotel - don't book with is if this is what you're after!\r\n\r\nWe are late sleepers and are addicted to keeping up with pop culture, with TV watching always high on our list of things to do. We eat dinner late and are always amending to our busy timetables.

I don't tend to visit touristy locations, I prefer to see the true essence of a city\/ country. Hopefully I can help you do the same when you are here in Melbourne.\r\n\r\nI like to keep my home tidy and clean and expect my guests to treat my home and my furniture with respect, as if it were their own.

Tony and I are easy-going, well-travelled, passionate about our home and garden, enjoy a glass of wine or two and love to cook!

Easy access into Melbourne's CBD means that regardless of traffic, on any given day you're only 10 minutes from town. The 96 tram sits right on your doorstop with trams scheduled to arrive every 10 minutes.  Away from the hustle and bustle of Brunswick Street, North Fitzroy hugs the Merri Creek and our house isn't too far of a walk from Dights Falls along the Yarra Trail. The falls mark the point where salt water from the sea meets the fresh water of the Yarra River and it's a stunning little spot for a picnic on a sunny, summer afternoon. Locally here in North Fitzroy we have some of the best bars, food and live entertainment that Melbourne has on offer. We love food and we also Melbourne so hit us up for any recommendations that we may have for that place to grab a quick bite or our top picks on local beer gardens. We're more than happy to steer you in the right direction when it comes to the Melb","notes":"Make use of our kitchen, chuck on a load of washing or use the clothes dryer.

We provide all guests with coffee, tea and things to prepare a light breakfast with in the mornings.  Scout Niblett lives here too. She's an adorable 8 year old english staffordshire terrier. She's internet famous and friendly to a fault. Scout's great with tiny humans and all other animals so we've listed this property as pet-friendly. And it is, to a point. Please message us prior to booking if you're travelling with your canine companion so we can work out the rest from there. Sometimes we do airport transfers also. If you're flying into Melbourne and you want to see if your luck will get you a lift to or from the Airport please contact us with your flight details and we can compare diaries\/logistics.","transit":"Public transport: Trams are iconically Melbourne and they don't just look cute, they're actually great for getting around. The 96 is right on our doorstep and takes you from North Fitzroy through the city and all the way down into St Kilda (and the beach) in just under an hour! Trams are safe, affordable and run like clockwork (approximately every 12 minutes). They also link in with the Melbourne Metro network (rail lines) which are an affordable and convenient way to get further afield with relative ease. Ask us when you arrive if you're planning on using PT to get around and we'll help you get your bearings and plan some of your journeys should you need. Bicycle:  We've got a bicycle for guests if that's something you're into. A security deposit is required but it's a quick and invigorating way to get around the local area with ample bike paths making getting anywhere a breeze.  Driving: On street parking is available. And free!","access":"Access into our home is via the front door. The property is wheelchair accessible and any guest requiring additional support with getting around is encouraged to get in contact with us at the time of your booking.

I love it all, from the beaches in Bali (a regular for me) to sights of Italy and shopping in Hong Kong Or London. I prefer to stay in 5 stars rather than under the stars camping. I like to keep fit  so know all the top running tracks near here and  I visit the fabulous Pilates or Yoga studio which are really close to me often. I love champagne and travelled to Reims for 3 months learning all about the art of champagne making. Visiting my local cafes or wine bar with friends on the weekend is what I love most. \r\n I have children, so I know what I want when traveling on my own: great restaurants, bars and a bit of glamorous shopping compared to when kids are with me and we want playgrounds, fun activities, family friendly restaurants or meals at home after an exhausting day out sightseeing. So when staying in my home I want to go that extra mile and give you tips to make your trip great.\r\nI have been staying in 5 star hotels for last 20 years so know a thing or 2 about what makes a good stay, a Great Stay. \r\nI want guests in my home to feel like it is their home. I can help with organising tickets to sporting events, meals at home waiting for you when you get in late, or organising a haircut or doctors appointment. The list is endless.

Oh and its 900m from a zone one train, close to bikeways including one direct from the airport.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":90,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/2225077\/profile_pic\/1335406170\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/2225077\/profile_pic\/1335406170\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":null,"host_listings_count":4,"host_total_listings_count":4,"host_verifications":["email","phone","facebook","reviews","manual_offline","jumio"],"street":"Pascoe Vale South, VIC 3044, Australia","neighbourhood":null,"neighbourhood_cleansed":"Moreland","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"Pascoe Vale South","state":"VIC","zipcode":"3044","market":"Melbourne","smart_location":"Pascoe Vale South, Australia","country_code":"AU","country":"Australia","latitude":"-37.73689691546649","longitude":"144.9329750496722","property_type":"House","room_type":"Private room","accommodates":4,"bathrooms":0.5,"bedrooms":1,"beds":2,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Internet","Wireless Internet","Kitchen","Pets live on this property","Other pet(s)","Indoor fireplace","Family\/kid friendly","Washer","Essentials","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace"],"square_feet":"0","price":58,"weekly_price":340,"monthly_price":900,"security_deposit":null,"cleaning_fee":12,"guests_included":1,"extra_people":12,"minimum_nights":1,"maximum_nights":1125,"calendar_updated":"a week ago","has_availability":null,"availability_30":17,"availability_60":18,"availability_90":48,"availability_365":323,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-04-03","number_of_reviews":19,"first_review":"2013-11-22","last_review":"2016-03-10","review_scores_rating":81,"review_scores_accuracy":8,"review_scores_cleanliness":7,"review_scores_checkin":9,"review_scores_communication":9,"review_scores_location":8,"review_scores_value":8,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":null,"cancellation_policy":"moderate","calculated_host_listings_count":4,"reviews_per_month":0.46,"features":["Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified","Is Location Exact"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.96916293002687,-37.81147286995559]},"properties":{"id":"6107273","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/6107273","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-03","name":"Comfy 1BR with rooftop pool","summary":"Stay in this 1BR apartment right in the heart of China Town.

I love new cultures, nature, creativity and adventures. I enjoy socialising and meeting new people and sharing some stories and laughs. I love creating a beautiful and nurturing home atmosphere, and doing things such as cooking delicious meals, pottering about in the garden, going on beach walks, catching up with friends, having quiet time at home and making and creating art. I also love cats!  \r\nMy favourite holiday destination so far is Byron Bay and Bali. I love the hot weather, and all things tropical. And the people in both places are very friendly and open minded and fun. \r\nI like British comedy, Australian drama series on abc, and documentaries by people such as Louis Theroux. \r\n\r\n5 things I can't live without are: a cat, my friends, my expressive dance classes, music, nature and colour!\r\n\r\nMy style of hosting is to be friendly and warm, yet respect the space and people and allow ease and comfort to prevail. \r\n\r\nThe beauty of Airbnb, is that it seems to bend the truth on the line 'there's no place like home'. It is wonderful that there is this system set up, whereby we can travel anywhere and experience other places, like home, but different, and be warmly welcomed, and do the things we do at home. I like that we can belong anywhere we go, with like-minded people, it opens doors which before never would have been explored.","host_response_time":"within a few hours","host_response_rate":90,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/pictures\/7c692edc-83da-4aff-81f9-a91794fcf7a1.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/pictures\/7c692edc-83da-4aff-81f9-a91794fcf7a1.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Bentleigh","host_listings_count":4,"host_total_listings_count":4,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio"],"street":"Beaumaris, VIC 3193, Australia","neighbourhood":null,"neighbourhood_cleansed":"Bayside","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"Beaumaris","state":"Victoria","zipcode":"3193","market":"Melbourne","smart_location":"Beaumaris, Australia","country_code":"AU","country":"Australia","latitude":"-37.98707544823319","longitude":"145.03726145098221","property_type":"House","room_type":"Private room","accommodates":2,"bathrooms":1.0,"bedrooms":1,"beds":3,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Wireless Internet","Air conditioning","Kitchen","Free parking on premises","Indoor fireplace","Heating","Family\/kid friendly","Washer","Dryer","Smoke detector","Essentials","Shampoo"],"square_feet":null,"price":115,"weekly_price":null,"monthly_price":null,"security_deposit":null,"cleaning_fee":55,"guests_included":1,"extra_people":0,"minimum_nights":1,"maximum_nights":1125,"calendar_updated":"today","has_availability":null,"availability_30":29,"availability_60":59,"availability_90":89,"availability_365":364,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-04-03","number_of_reviews":5,"first_review":"2015-11-08","last_review":"2017-03-17","review_scores_rating":96,"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":8,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":9,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":null,"cancellation_policy":"strict","calculated_host_listings_count":4,"reviews_per_month":0.29,"features":["Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified","Is Location Exact"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.96614305738063,-37.808035484641586]},"properties":{"id":"14891153","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/14891153","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-03","name":"Your 5-star home in inner city Melb","summary":"King Size bed, 5 star sweet suite in the inner city.
